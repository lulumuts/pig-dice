    <h1>Pig Dice</h1>
      <h2>How to play:</h2>
      <p>Two players roll the dice. Player 1 plays first and his total is added up until he reaches a total of 100.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If either player rolls 1, there turn is over and they score nothing.</li>
        <li>If two 1's are rolled, the player's entire score is lost, and the turn ends.</li>
        <li>If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total, but the player <strong>MUST</strong> roll again.</li>
      </ul>
